# JavaScript Basics Projects

This repository contains beginner-level JavaScript projects that I built as part of my learning journey during the **Dev Weekends Fellowship**. 
These hands-on projects helped reinforce key JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, functions, logic building, and user input.

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. Color Changer
A simple app that changes the background color randomly on button click.  
**Concepts:** Event handling, DOM manipulation, arrays, functions.

### 2. BMI Generator
Takes user input (height and weight) and calculates the Body Mass Index.  
**Concepts:** User input, conditional statements, functions, data validation.

### 3. Digital Clock
Displays the current time, updating every second in real-time.  
**Concepts:** Date object, setInterval, time formatting.

### 4. Guess the Number
A number guessing game where the user tries to guess a random number within a limited number of attempts.  
**Concepts:** Loops, conditionals, user interaction, random number generation.
